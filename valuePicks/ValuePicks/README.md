Make It Pretty

Designated Googler: Ryan

A. Our app was build around giving people an edge over the competition in their daily fantasy football rosters.

B.  ValuePicks provides the tools necessary to be competitive against your 'know-it-all-asshole' friends who think they know everything about football, little do they know you have ValuePicks on your side.

C. First we researched what other FF apps. We noticed that most of them just tell you who they think will do good that week instead of giving you the info in one place so you could make the best decision based on what you think and you gut.
