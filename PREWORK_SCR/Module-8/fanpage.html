     <h2>BIO</h2>


     <p>Outkast (stylized as OutKast) is an American hip hop duo formed in 1991, in East Point, Atlanta, Georgia, composed of Atlanta-based rappers André "André 3000" Benjamin (formerly known as Dré) and Antwan "Big Boi" Patton. 
        The duo achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success in the 1990s and early 2000s, helping to popularize Southern hip hop while developing distinctive personas and experimenting with diverse genres such as funk, psychedelia, techno, and gospel.
        Outkast in my opinion is one of the most underrated rap groups of all time. Andre 3000 is also considered one of the best lyricist of all time. Even tho they haven't released an new album in over 12 yrs they are still in a lot of peoples minds when you menition
        greatest rap group of all time. </p>
